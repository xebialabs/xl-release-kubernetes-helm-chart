  Include all volumes already being used with old Docker images.
  In case of the "conf" volume, make sure also to update any configurations required by the new version "check release notes",
  before mounting it to new version of the container.
  Update the environment variables to include FORCE_UPGRADE:
  Note: The folders you mount must to be owned by user 10001. For example, if you want to mount directories under ~/XebiaLabs/ folder,
  to change the ownership you can run sudo chown -R 10001 ~/XebiaLabs/ .
  The xl-release.conf file and script.policy are generated by the container startup script based on the environment variables set.
  To prevent this from happening, you can set the GENERATE_XL_CONFIG environment variable to false. Once the variable is set,
  the xl-release.conf for the product will not be generated based on environment variables and you would have to provide this file yourself.
